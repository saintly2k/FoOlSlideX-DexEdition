<h2 class="text-2xl">Naming Rules</h2>
<p>
    <b>Order Number</b><br>
    The absolute order. Sorts all chapters by this number. If left blank, the chapter number will be inserted.<br>
    <b>Chapter Number</b><br>
    Number only, decimals allowed. Example: <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">0</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">3.5</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">18</span><br>
    Use <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">0</span> for Prologue and name the release name Prologue below.<br>
    Use decimals (Example: <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1.5</span>) for special/bonus/omake/etc.<br>
    Use <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1</span> for Oneshot and name the release name Oneshot below.<br>
    <b>Volume Number</b><br>
    Number only, decimals not allowed. Example: <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">2</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">3</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">18</span><br>
    <b>Release name</b><br>
    By default, we will automatically generate a release name based on the value of volume number and chapter
    number.<br>
    You can customize the release name by filling in this field. However, automatic sorting is still determined by the
    values of chapter and volume, and is not affected by the release name you inputed here.<br>
    Example: <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Chapter 6</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Episode 99</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Season 2 Ep
        18</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">ISSUE 23</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Punch 1024</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Day 1001</span>
    <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Prologue</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">Oneshot</span><br>
    <b>Release name short Version</b><br>
    Short version of the release name. May be used on some small screen devices.<br>
    Example: <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">C6</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">E99</span>
    <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">S2E18</span><br>
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl">Archive Order</h2>
<p>
    <b>Only .zip archives are allowed! They cannot have subdirectories and cannot be password protected.</b>
    The webserver displays all images ordered by their name. For example, there are images <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1.png</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">2.png</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">3.png</span>, it will display them as <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1 2 3</span>. However, if there are images like <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1.png</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">5.png</span> <span
        class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">8.png</span> <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">10.png</span>, it
    will order them like <span class="bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">1 10 5 8</span>. To prevent this, please zero-pad the
    images. (01.png, 05.png, 08.png, 10.png) to achieve the proper order.
